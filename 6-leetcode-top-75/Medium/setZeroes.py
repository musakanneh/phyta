    Given an m x n matrix. If an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.

    Follow up:
    --------------
    A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
    A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
    Could you devise a constant space solution?
