"""Merge Two Sorted Lists"""

"""Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. 
The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
----------------
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
----------------
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
----------------
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
