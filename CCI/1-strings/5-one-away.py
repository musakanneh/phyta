"""One Away

Question:
    There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
    remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to 
    check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
    
    EXAMPLE
    
    pales, pale -> true
    pale, bale -> true
    pale, bake -> true
    pale, ple -> false
