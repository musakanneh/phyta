"""Palindrome Permutation

Question:
    Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­
    drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
    A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be 
    limited to just dictionary words.
    
    Example:
    Input: Tact Coa
    
    Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
