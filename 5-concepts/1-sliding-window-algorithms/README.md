## Problems
1. Suppose the problem gives us an array of length n and a number k. The problem asks us to find the maximum sum of k consecutive elements inside the array.
2. Suppose we have n books aligned in a row. For each book, we know the number of minutes needed to read it. However, we only have k free minutes to read. Also, we should read some consecutive books from the row. In other words, we can choose a range from the books in the row and read them. Of course, the condition is that the sum of time needed to read the books mustnâ€™t exceed k.
